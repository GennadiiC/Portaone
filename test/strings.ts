export const longText: string = `The Tao gave birth to machine language.  
Machine language gave birth
to the assembler.
The assembler gave birth to the compiler.  Now there are ten thousand
languages.
Each language has its purpose, however humble.  Each language
expresses the Yin and Yang of software.  Each language has its place within
the Tao.
But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.

export const longText2: string = `The code above (which is mine--that's my blog) gets you pretty close. 
A small tweak and you're there. First of all, you can see if arr.length and out.length 
are the same. If they are the same, there are no duplicated elements. But you want a little more. 
If you want to "catch" the dupes as they happen, check to see if the length of the array 
increases after the obj[arr[i]]=0 line. Nifty, eh? :-) Thanks for the nice words, Raphael Montanaro.`
